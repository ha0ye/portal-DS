# Abstract

# Introduction

Change in complex systems is difficult to measure:
  - many different variables are observed, high-dimensional problem
  - changes can occur as a result of endogenous mechanisms, external forcing, and the interaction between them. causes and effects can be both deterministic and stochastic
  - This is challenge for developing effective, *general* indicators for health and possible abrupt shift.

Dynamic Stability is an approach to describe multi-dimensional change using a single metric:
  - related to the classical measure of system stability (dominant eigenvalue of the Community Matrix, Novak et al. 2016, Pimm 1984)
  - uses empirical dynamic modeling to estimate changing interaction strengths over time (i.e. the components of the community matrix), resulting in a state- and time-dependent measure of the dominant eigenvalue
  - in theory, characterizes whether change in the system is expanding or contracting.



## Main Question

Can this approach be used to quantify abrupt changes at Portal?
