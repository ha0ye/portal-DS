## Overview

The goal of portalDS is to apply "dynamic stability" (Ushio et al. 2018) to the long-term rodent time series at Portal, to test whether this indicator of whole-ecosystem change predicts or lines up with abrupt community shifts.

## Project Organization

This project is set up as an R package that implements functions for computing "dynamic stability", mostly following Ben Marwick's [rrtools](https://github.com/benmarwick/rrtools) setup:

* The `maizuru-dynamic-stability` vignette reproduces the Maizuru Bay analysis from Ushio et al. 2018 as an example.
* The `analysis` folder contains R scripts and objects for the Portal dynamic stability analysis.
* The `data`, `output`, and `figures` folders contain data, results, and figures for both the Portal and the Maizuru Bay analysis.

## Installation

You can install the current version of portalDS from [GitHub](https://github.com/ha0ye/portalDS) with:

``` r
# install.packages("remotes")
remotes::install_github("ha0ye/portalDS")
```
